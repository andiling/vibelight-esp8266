# VibeLight 2.0 (with ESP8266)

This project is the improved concept of the [VibeLight Gateway](https://github.com/bastianraschke/vibelightgateway). It uses a small Arduino compatible ESP8266 chip (in my case the NodeMCU board) to provide a Wifi connected distributed ambiance light system. The device communicates with a MQTT broker (in my case [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)) to control arbitrary light effects. You can install nearly any amount of light actors in your room.

This enhanced version of the VibeLight system uses a native iOS app developed in the modern Swift programming language. You can open the project with Xcode to deploy the app to your iOS device.

The project is [fully documentated](https://sicherheitskritisch.de/2016/08/iot-stimmungslicht-mit-esp8266-steuerbar-Ã¼ber-internet-via-ios-app/) on my blog [Sicherheitskritisch](https://sicherheitskritisch.de).
